# Garden Helper
This program was created to help people track the plants, grow beds, and harvests from their gardens. This web application allows a user to create a model representing a grow bed, that allows a user to record the plants growing in each respective bed. Additionally, models for harvests from each plant can be created.

## Usage

After unzipping and saving the contents to the desired directory, and run 'bundle install' to install all the gems required for this program.

From within that directory, run 'rails s' in your terminal, then open 'localhost:3000' in a web browser.

The program will run and prompt user to sign-up or login.

The close the program, logout of your account, exit your web browser, and type 'contrl + C' in your terminal to exit rails server.
